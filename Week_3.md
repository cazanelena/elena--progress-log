## Guidance
Answer the following questions considering the [learning outcomes for this week](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/syllabus/developer/authentication/learning-outcomes/).
Make sure to record evidence of your processes. You can use code snippets, screenshots or any other material to support your answers.

Do not fill in the feedback section. The Founders and Coders team will update this with feedback on your progress.

## Assessment
 ### 1. Show evidence of a learning outcome you have achieved this week.
CookieParser and using hidden variables. This was set up locally on the package.json but once the app was deployed to fly.io will automatically crash because the cookies secret was not visable to the fly server. To fix this I went on the fly's documentation and bewlow was the command line that fixed my problem. :)
